# Product Requirements Document: ipatool-web

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for the `ipatool` command-line application. The goal is to create a user-friendly, visually appealing, and secure web interface that simplifies the process of downloading iOS application (`.ipa`) files.

## 2. Target Audience

*   Users of the `ipatool` CLI who prefer a graphical interface.
*   Individuals who need to download `.ipa` files for their iCloud accounts but are not comfortable with command-line tools.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1. User Authentication

*   **iCloud Login:** Users must be able to securely authenticate with their iCloud account (Apple ID and password).
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** The interface must support the submission of 2FA codes sent to the user's trusted devices.
*   **Secure Credential Handling:** Credentials must not be stored on the server. They should be passed directly to the `ipatool` process and discarded immediately after use.

### 3.2. Application Search and Discovery

*   **Search Functionality:** A search bar to find iOS applications by name or Bundle ID.
*   **Search Results:** The interface will display a list of matching applications, including:
    *   App Icon
    *   App Name
    *   App Version
    *   Bundle ID

### 3.3. Application Download

*   **Download Button:** Each application in the search results will have a clear "Download" button.
*   **Download Process:** Clicking the download button will initiate the `.ipa` file download via the backend `ipatool` process.
*   **File Handling:** The downloaded `.ipa` file will be streamed from the server to the user's browser, so it is never stored on the server.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)

*   **Technology:** The frontend will be a single-page application built with React and TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** The UI will adhere to Material Design principles, using the Bootstrap framework for a clean, modern, and responsive layout.
*   **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and require minimal instruction for a user to operate.

### 4.2. Backend

*   **Technology:** The backend will be a Node.js server using the Express framework.
*   **API:** A RESTful API will facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
*   **`ipatool` Integration:** The backend will execute `ipatool` commands as a child process to handle authentication and downloads.

### 4.3. Security

*   **No Credential Storage:** User credentials will never be stored on the server.
*   **Secure Communication:** Communication between the frontend and backend will be over HTTPS (in a production environment).

## 5. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1)

*   **Download History:** A view to see previously downloaded applications.
*   **Batch Downloads:** The ability to queue and download multiple applications at once.
*   **Account Management:** The ability to save and switch between multiple iCloud accounts.
